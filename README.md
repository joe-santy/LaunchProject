# LaunchProject

This program helps with the development of new apps or websites.

To use, run 'node LaunchProject' on the command line.

A couple of questions will get you started with installing dependencies and choosing a bootstrap template.  A simple express server will also be installed in the new project directory.

Good luck on your projects!
